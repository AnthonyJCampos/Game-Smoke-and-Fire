First Software/Game. Smoke &amp; Fire is a Drinking Card Game 

Smoke & Fire is a Drinking Card Game that I was taught during my undergrad. I developed it during my 2nd course in Java during the spring of 2020. The goal was to bring a smile to my friends by developing a game that we played in our earlier 20s. The idea was to create something familiar that was a physical activity into software as we could no longer meet in person due to the pandemic.  Additionally, it was a tool to explore concepts, software design, and OOP.  Unfortunately, I was very new to programming and software design at the time as I was only in my 2nd course and was not knowledgeable on network implementation, so the game is currently only able to be played locally for 1-8 players.
